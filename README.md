# real-time-body-measurement
This project leverages Python, Mediapipe, and OpenCV to estimate human body measurements such as shoulder width, chest width, hip width, torso length, and leg length using a webcam feed. The program captures a frame after a 5-second countdown, detects key body landmarks with Mediapipe's Pose module, and calculates measurements using a scaling factor derived from a reference object. The results are displayed on the screen and saved in an Excel file (body_measurements.xlsx). To use the program, ensure dependencies like OpenCV, Mediapipe, Pandas, and OpenPyXL are installed, then run the script and position yourself in front of the camera during the countdown. The program can be customized by adjusting the reference width or modifying the countdown duration. This project is open-source and licensed under MIT.
